<h1>Welcome to my barebones website</h1>

<p>I know next to nothing about webdev but thanks to <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a> was able to cobble together a moderately appealing design in about 20 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="sodoyouplanonmakingitlessshitty">So. . . do you plan on making it <strong>less</strong> shitty?</h2>

<p>Yes! I'm currently reading through the tutorials on <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a> to learn how to use Pelican to generate a static website using Python.</p>

<p>I hope to use this website to host:</p>

<ul>
<li>a blog documenting my learning experiences</li>

<li>a collection of my projects (if you can call them that)</li>

<li>my contact information</li>

<li>my resume (once I feel job-ready)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="waitwhythehelldoyouneedtouseastaticwebsitegeneratortohostyourcontactinformationandprojects">Wait, why the hell do you need to use a static website generator to host your contact information and projects?</h2>

<h3 id="randomthingsthatidecidedtohostonthewebsite">Random things that I decided to host on the website</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="/Notes.html">Notes From The Underground</a> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">Gutenberg</a> and prettified using the simple CSS that runs on this website. One of my favorite books and something I think everybody should read at least once before they die.</p>
