Really cool of the guys and gals of github to allow you to host a website for free, hope to use it to learn [Pelican](https://www.fullstackpython.com/pelican.html)
and build myself a respectable landing page.

## Legal stuff 
All of the books hosted on this website were acquired from [Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org) and are in the public domain. Feel free to do whatever you want with them. (though you should probably just read them)
