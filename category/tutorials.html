</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>According to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/los-angeles-web-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IM508_KO12,25.htm">Glassdoor,</a> the average salary for a web developer in my area is around 80,000 dollars, which is nearly double what <a href="http://work.chron.com/annual-salary-street-magicians-24501.html">magicians,</a>, <a href="https://www.simplyhired.com/salaries-k-the-snake-charmer-jobs.html">snake charmers</a>, and <a href="https://www.growinggenerations.com/surrogacy-program/surrogates/surrogate-mother-pay/">people who give birth to other people's babies</a> make in a year, so you'd be forgiven for thinking of web development as an arcane craft practiced by only the most gifted of Silicon Valley wizards. However, the truth of the matter is that if you were able to install a browser on your computer and access this website then you're likely perfectly capable of using a static site generator to create a website every bit as shitty and basic as the one you're on right now, and by the end of this blog post you should have all the tools and knowledge needed to do so.</p>
<h2>The Journey of a Thousand Significant Lines Of Code. . .</h2>
<p>Does not begin with a single step, contrary to what some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">pre-internet blogger weirdo</a> said. It begins with figuring out what you're trying to accomplish (not as easy as it sounds) and (roughly) how you plan on accomplishing it. Luckily, since you're lazy and I'm generous, I'll be doing the majority of the project planning for you this time around and providing you with all the neccesarry knowledge and resources in order to accomplish it. </p>
<p>We're building a Static Website using Pelican, which is a static site generator written in Python. If you're worried about not being able to continue this tutorial because you don't know or understand Python, then don't be. Pelican requires absolutely no knowledge of Python beyond how to install and evoke it's interpreter.  </p>                </article>
